## Feature Overview:
Add an agent that detects if required functionality is already implemented and reuses existing functions to avoid duplication.

## Goal:
Increase efficiency by reusing existing code and preventing redundant implementations.

## Implementation Notes:
- Scan the instance for existing scripts/functions.
- Match user requests to current functionality.
- Suggest reusing or extending existing code.

## Example:
A user requests a notification function; the agent finds a similar one and suggests modifying or using it directly.

## Benefits:
- Reduces code duplication
- Promotes code reuse
- Streamlines development
