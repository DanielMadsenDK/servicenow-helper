### Feature Overview:
Currently, users can specify their ServiceNow instance, but this is not leveraged for contextual functionality. The integration should use this information to provide more relevant and instance-specific data and actions.

### Goal:
Enhance integration so that context from the user's ServiceNow instance is used throughout the app to improve recommendations, troubleshooting, and automation.

### Implementation Notes:
- Use the instance info to fetch contextual data, such as user roles, active modules, and customizations.
- Adapt answers and actions based on instance specifics.
- Ensure privacy and security.

### Example:
If a user asks about an incident workflow, the app should reference the actual configuration in their instance.

### Benefits:
- Personalized answers and suggestions
- More accurate troubleshooting
- Increased user trust
